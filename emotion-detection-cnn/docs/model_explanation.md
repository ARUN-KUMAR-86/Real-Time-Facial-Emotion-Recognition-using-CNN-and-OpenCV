# CNN Model Explanation

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial emotions.

- Input: 48x48 grayscale face images
- Convolution layers extract facial features
- MaxPooling reduces image size
- Fully connected layers classify emotions
- Softmax outputs emotion probabilities
